UI Kitten is a React Native UI Library that allows you creating stunning multi-brand cross-platform mobile applications. 
The library is based on Eva Design System which brings consistency and scalability in the design and development process. 
It contains a set of general purpose UI components styled in a similar way. 
And the most awesome thing: the themes can be changed in the runtime, with no need to reload the application.
